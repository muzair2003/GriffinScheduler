This is a personal project of mine.
This program allows Students or professionals with a consistent weekly timetable to be able to see all possible organization of their time.

This program uses object oriented skills, pointers, recursion, and many algorithms.

This has been coded in C++ with the use of Qt and its many useful libraries.
